feat: add Claude AI integration with desktop app and CLI support

This commit introduces comprehensive Claude AI support to the dotfiles system:

## What was added:
- New `claude/` directory with complete installation and configuration setup
- Claude desktop app integration via Homebrew cask
- Claude Code CLI installation using NVM Node.js 20.17.0 environment
- Configuration templates and documentation

## Key components:
- `claude/install.sh`: Idempotent installation script following dotfiles contract
- `claude/README.md`: Comprehensive documentation with usage instructions
- `claude/claude-config.json`: Configuration template for Claude Code
- `claude/CLAUDE.md.example`: Example project guide template

## Bug fixes:
- Fixed critical bug in `bin/check-updates` for scoped npm packages parsing
- The script was incorrectly parsing packages like `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@1.0.3`
- Updated parsing logic to handle scoped packages (starting with @) correctly

## Integration improvements:
- Claude Code now properly integrates with the dotfiles update system
- Uses NVM Node.js 20.17.0 environment to match existing dotfiles patterns
- Properly detected and managed by `bin/dot` and `check-updates` scripts

## Brewfile updates:
- Added Claude desktop app as a managed cask
- Documented unavailable Claude CLI tap for future reference

This ensures Claude AI tools are properly managed within the dotfiles ecosystem
while maintaining consistency with existing patterns and conventions.
