#!/usr/bin/osascript
#
# A small command line script to change screen resolutions on macOs Sierra`.
#
# Primarily I switch between two resolutions on my Retina MacBook Pro: Retina,
# and the full resolution setting. This means for particular apps I use, I can
# quickly jump between seeing more pixels and less.
#
# There doesn't appear to be an easy way to do this without just using
# AppleScript to automate clicking buttons, so that's what this does.
#
# Most of this script is adapted from this helpful answer:

tell application "System Preferences"
	reveal anchor "displaysDisplayTab" of pane "com.apple.preference.displays"
